Project Description: Braitenberg Vehicles (1–4)

This project implements Braitenberg Vehicles 1 to 4, demonstrating how simple sensor–motor connections can produce complex and seemingly intelligent behaviors. Each vehicle is designed using different wiring strategies between sensors and actuators to study emergent behavior.

Vehicle 1 – Direct Positive Connection (Fear / Aggression)

Description:
Vehicle 1 uses a direct (excitatory) connection between sensors and motors. An increase in sensor input results in an increase in motor speed on the same side.

Behavior:

Moves faster as it approaches a stimulus

Shows aggressive or fear-like behavior

Tends to rush toward or away from strong stimuli

Key Concept:
Simple direct wiring can lead to reactive behavior without any internal decision-making.

Vehicle 2 – Crossed Connection (Love / Attraction)

Description:
Vehicle 2 implements crossed sensor–motor connections, where the left sensor controls the right motor and vice versa.

Behavior:

Turns towards the stimulus

Gradually approaches the source

Exhibits attraction-like behavior

Key Concept:
Cross-wiring creates smooth goal-oriented motion using only local sensor feedback.

Vehicle 3 – Inhibitory Connection (Explorer / Avoider)

Description:
Vehicle 3 introduces inhibitory connections, where increased sensor input reduces motor speed.

Behavior:

Slows down near strong stimuli

Avoids collisions

Demonstrates cautious or exploratory behavior

Key Concept:
Inhibition enables regulation and avoidance without explicit planning.

Vehicle 4 – Crossed + Inhibitory Connection (Curious / Balanced Behavior)

Description:
Vehicle 4 combines crossed connections with inhibition, resulting in more balanced and adaptive movement.

Behavior:

Orbits or circles around stimuli

Maintains optimal distance

Displays complex, stable motion patterns

Key Concept:
Combining wiring strategies leads to emergent intelligence from minimal control rules.
